#Beacon
	Bluetooth low energy (Bluetooth LE, BLE, marketed as Bluetooth Smart) is a wireless personal area network technology designed and marketed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, fitness, beacons, security, and home entertainment industries. 
The beacon does not require any pairing permissions from the other devices. It works on BLE and can last for around 2 years on a single cell. Beacons are not limited by the number of devices and constantly transmit signals to receiving devices. The data traffic flows in only one way so it is protected from any malicious activities and can only be changed by authorized devices. 
PROBLEMS FACED IN MUSEUMS 
•	Guides charge lot of money from customers for Museum tours.
•	Tourists usually face the language barrier.
•	Indoor tracking is not possible in present Museums.
•	The tourists have to wait in long queues to buy the tickets.
bMUSEUM 
We are trying to make an app, which is based on Beacon technology that can act as a virtual guide in a museum. The app will provide the following features----
•	The app will provide indoor tracing of the Museum.
•	The app will automatically provide the information (text, video and audio) about the artifacts whenever the user will come in the range of the beacon placed near the artifact in the language preferred by the user and the information will be from the verified source.
•	The app provides the facility to buy tickets online hence the tourists will not have to stand in long queues to buy the tickets.
